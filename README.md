Created a split page using html, css and javascript.
Using css, the main div which contained the two divs that'll divide the screen, I made the width of the parent div 50% so as to attain equal with of the children divs. 
I created an overlaY using a before effect and transition for a smooth entering and exiting 
Using css, a created a hover effect on the buttons
Using javascript, I listened for the event of mouse leaving and entering and to create the split movement i added and removed the class that increased the width on mouseenter.
